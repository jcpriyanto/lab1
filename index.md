*Who am I as a person.*

I am just your typical guy who enjoys simple things. I don't like to overthink and I would dispose everything that is not important. I can set my priorities straight, and this is why I tend to complete all my task. My favorite quote comes from a popular animated movie:

> Yesterday is history, tommorow is a mystery, and today is a gift. That is why it is called present.

*Who am I as a programmer.*

As a programmer, I aspire to be a Software Engineer that could create new things that would benefit the people in need. In other words, people who lack access to the current technology we have, who have disabilities, etc.
